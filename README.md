# Real-time-control-system-for-a-forward-loader
In general, the course is to design and implement a real-time control system for a 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulic loader (i.e. boom) and test it in a rapid prototyping environment. Starting with defining Use Cases, Requirements and Preliminary Design. After that, Rapid Prototyping environment is included with IHA 3D environment. At third phase, implementation is done both  in off-line and online with Rapid Prototyping environment which includes User Interface and most of functionalities of the system is be done.
general, the course exercise requires students to design and implement a real-time control system for a 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulic loader (i.e. boom) and test it in a rapid prototyping environment
